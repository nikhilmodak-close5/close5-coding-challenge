# close5-coding-challenge

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/nikhilmodak-close5/close5-code-challenge.git
cd close5-code-challenge
npm install
```

## Run

```
node app
```

## Implementations:

I have 2 implementations in 2 branches:

### master: 

This uses minimal set of dependencies (express and lodash). 
I used certain algorithms for specific searches and sorts and added comments in the code about my assumptions and reasoning behind choosing the algorithms. 
Tests can be run using ```npm test```. Tests created only for the api, I could not find time to write out tests for rest of files in lib.

### sails: 

This is something, I would typically do for prototyping something fast. 
I have used sailsjs because of it flexibility and ease of use. I have used it in past for some projects, but not on customer facing productions sites.
